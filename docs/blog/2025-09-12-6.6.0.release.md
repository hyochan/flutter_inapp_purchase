# 6.6.0 Release

Short and sweet — this release brings the Android migration to openiap-google,
tighter null-safety, and example stability fixes. We also rolled in the follow
up maintenance work that shipped as 6.6.1 so you have a single snapshot of the
6.6 line.

## Highlights

- Android: Switched to openiap-google with coroutine-based connection gating and improved error logging.
- Dart: More robust product parsing and safer generics to avoid UI stalls.
- iOS: Added small helper methods (subscription group, App Store country, typed app transaction, histories).
- Example: Guarded mounted across async paths to prevent setState after dispose.
- Tooling: Pre-commit formatting matches CI; avoids staging untracked files.

## Breaking Changes & Migration

We’re standardizing identifiers and tokens across platforms. Please review and migrate accordingly.

### Transaction Identifier

- Canonical field: `purchase.id`
- Deprecated: `transactionId` (kept for compatibility, will be removed in a future release)
- Impacted APIs:
  - Finish transaction on iOS now uses `purchase.id` internally. If you previously passed or stored `transactionId`, switch to `purchase.id`.

Before

```dart
await FlutterInappPurchase.instance.finishTransaction(
  purchase, // relies on purchase.transactionId
);
```

After

```dart
await FlutterInappPurchase.instance.finishTransaction(
  purchase, // uses purchase.id (canonical)
);
final txnId = purchase.id; // use this instead of transactionId
```

### Purchase Token

- Canonical field: `purchaseToken`
- Deprecated: `purchaseTokenAndroid` (use `purchaseToken` everywhere)
- Android subscription upgrade/downgrade:
  - When specifying the existing subscription, pass the token under `purchaseToken`.

Before

```dart
await requestPurchase(
  'premium_monthly',
  replacementModeAndroid: AndroidReplacementMode.withTimeProration.value,
  purchaseTokenAndroid: existingSub.purchaseToken,
);
```

After

```dart
await FlutterInappPurchase.instance.requestPurchase(
  options: RequestPurchase(
    android: AndroidRequestSubscriptionProps(
      skus: ['premium_monthly'],
      subscriptionOffers: myOffers,
      // unified token field
      // when calling platform channel beneath, the key is `purchaseToken`
    ),
  ),
);
// For server validation, always send `purchase.purchaseToken` (Android)
```

### Receipt Data (iOS)

- Canonical verification input: `purchaseToken` (JWS representation from StoreKit 2)
- Deprecated: `transactionReceipt` for server-side verification flows
- App-side verification:
  - Use `validateReceiptIOS(sku: ...)` for local testing only. It returns a JWS as `purchaseToken`.
  - For production, send the returned `purchaseToken` to your server and verify with Apple public keys.

Before

```dart
// Legacy (server hits Apple verifyReceipt endpoint with raw receipt)
await http.post(url, body: {'receipt-data': purchase.transactionReceipt});
```

After

```dart
final res = await FlutterInappPurchase.instance.validateReceiptIOS(sku: productId);
if (res.isValid) {
  await yourServer.verifyIOS(purchaseToken: res.purchaseToken); // JWS
}
```

Clarification

- Use `purchase.id` as the canonical transaction identifier for logging, idempotency, and `finishTransaction` on iOS.
- Receipt verification itself uses `purchaseToken` (JWS), not `purchase.id` or `transactionId`.

### What to change in your code

- Replace `purchase.transactionId` with `purchase.id`.
- Replace `purchaseTokenAndroid` with `purchaseToken`.
- For iOS server verification, stop sending `transactionReceipt`; switch to the JWS returned as `purchaseToken`.

### Notes on Backward Compatibility

- This release keeps `transactionId` and `transactionReceipt` readable to ease migration, but they are deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
- Internally, finishing transactions on iOS already uses `purchase.id`.

## 6.6.1 follow-up

- Completed docs/examples migration from `PurchasedItem` → `Purchase` so the new
  types are consistent everywhere.
- Added unified helpers that callers had to bolt on manually:
  - `Purchase.quantity` (iOS quantity, defaults to 1 on Android)
  - `Purchase.isAutoRenewing`
- Hardened product parsing so `Product.id` is always populated regardless of
  store quirks.
- Example UX tweaks: no alert for user-cancelled purchases; avoids returning
  inside `finally` blocks.
- Analyzer clean-up: targeted ignores for legacy symbols, opacity lints, and
  duplicate library directives.
