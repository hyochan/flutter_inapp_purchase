Release 6.8.0 graduates flutter_inapp_purchase into the full OpenIAP ecosystem.
The plugin now shares the same native stacks, type system, and tooling used by
Expo IAP and the Kotlin Multiplatform SDK, giving Flutter teams a predictable
upgrade path and richer diagnostics across both stores.

## Highlights

- Flutter In-App Purchase 6.8.0 graduates the project into the full **OpenIAP ecosystem**. The release ships with three dedicated native stacks:

  - **[openiap-apple](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap-apple)** — StoreKit 2 implementation for Apple platforms
  - **[openiap-google](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap-google)** — Google Play Billing integration for Android
  - **[openiap-gql](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap-gql)** — GraphQL helpers that drive types and tooling

  From 6.8.0 onward, Flutter In-App Purchase stays in lockstep with these modules: Apple v1.2.2, Google v1.2.6, and GQL v1.0.8. That shared version alignment gives Flutter apps stable native compatibility and a unified type system straight from the OpenIAP schema.

## Tooling and workflow

- Type generation, Podspecs, and Gradle builds all consume `openiap-versions.json`
  so dependency bumps require one edit.

## Important changes

- `getProducts`, `getSubscriptions`, and `getPurchaseHistories` are permanently
  removed. Use `fetchProducts(ProductRequest(...))` and
  `getAvailablePurchases([PurchaseOptions(...)])` instead.
- Purchase request helpers require explicit product types; passing the old
  “all” value throws an error to prevent invalid store calls.
- Transaction identifiers surfaced by the stores remain untouched. For new
  server-side validation, rely on the unified `purchaseToken` exposed on every
  purchase record.
- **Transaction identifiers**: `transactionId` is reinstated as the primary store
  reference (`orderId` on Android, StoreKit transaction ID on iOS). Android’s
  generic `id` is no longer repurposed for orders; when Google Play omits an
  `orderId` (typical for consumables), `transactionId` becomes `null` and clients
  should rely on the unified `purchaseToken` (Android purchase token / iOS JWS).
  This value is the canonical receipt for server validation. See the related
  [react-native-iap discussion](https://github.com/hyochan/react-native-iap/discussions/3016).
