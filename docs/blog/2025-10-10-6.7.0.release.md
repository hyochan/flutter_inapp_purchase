We’ve shipped 6.7.0 with a fully consolidated OpenIAP stack and a key Android
fix for subscription upgrades. This release focuses on keeping the platform
plugins in lockstep and smoothing out offer handling on Play Store builds.

## Highlights

- **Single OpenIAP surface** – Dart now targets `openiap-gql@1.0.2` while the
  native plugins use `openiap-google@1.1.11` and `openiap-apple@1.1.12`. The
  three packages are versioned together, removing the “mix and match” problem
  from earlier releases.
- **Android offerToken fix** – `requestPurchase` now forwards the subscription
  `offerToken` correctly, so Play Billing picks the intended base plan/offer.
- **Consistent error enums** – Error-code enums have been normalized to
  PascalCase, matching the OpenIAP schema and making switching between Dart and
  native references painless.

## Why it matters

Keeping the OpenIAP packages in lockstep means:

- predictable GraphQL schema updates (`openiap-gql@1.0.2`),
- the latest Google Play Billing v8 glue (`openiap-google@1.1.11`), and
- Apple StoreKit improvements (`openiap-apple@1.1.12`).

You no longer need to pin different versions manually—`flutter_inapp_purchase`
6.7.0 brings them all in together.

The Android `offerToken` fix is critical if you sell subscriptions with base
plan offers. Prior to 6.7.0, the token could be dropped when the request reached
native code, making upgrades fall back to the default price.

Finally, aligning the error enums to PascalCase makes it easier to map between
Dart and native error codes (and matches the generated OpenIAP types). If you
reference the enum names directly, update your code to the new casing.

## Upgrade notes

```bash
flutter pub get
# Android
flutter build apk   # or: ./gradlew -p android assembleRelease
# iOS
cd example/ios && pod install
```

If you previously vendored a different OpenIAP version, remove those overrides
so the bundled packages take effect.

## Looking ahead

6.7.1 will continue sanding the edges, but 6.7.0 is the release that unifies the
OpenIAP toolchain and fixes the outstanding subscription upgrade bug. Let us
know how it works for you!
