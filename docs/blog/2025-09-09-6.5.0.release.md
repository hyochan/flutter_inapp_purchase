We’ve shipped 6.5.0 with improved iOS parity to OpenIAP, safer parsing, and stronger pre‑commit checks.

Highlights

- iOS: channel method rename `buyProduct` → `requestPurchase` (Dart updated accordingly)
- Standardized error codes/messages via OpenIAP (`OpenIapErrorEvent.defaultMessage`)
- More robust product parsing when native returns numbers for string fields
- Better restore flow: iOS runs `syncIOS()` then `getAvailablePurchases()`
- iOS helpers: `clearTransactionIOS`, `getPromotedProductIOS`, `requestPurchaseOnPromotedProductIOS`
- Pre‑commit hook now formats, analyzes, and runs tests by default

Podspec now requires `openiap ~> 1.1.7`. The example Podfile uses the CocoaPods CDN and can pin the git tag if the trunk index lags.

See CHANGELOG for details. Thanks for all the feedback and reviews!
