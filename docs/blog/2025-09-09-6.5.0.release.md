We've shipped 6.5.0 with improved iOS parity to OpenIAP, safer parsing, and
stronger pre-commit checks. The later 6.5.2/6.5.3 fixes are folded in here so
you can see the full picture of the 6.5.x line.

Highlights

- iOS: channel method rename `buyProduct` → `requestPurchase` (Dart updated accordingly)
- Standardized error codes/messages via OpenIAP (`OpenIapError.defaultMessage`)
- Better restore flow: iOS runs `syncIOS()` then `getAvailablePurchases()`
- iOS helpers: `clearTransactionIOS`, `getPromotedProductIOS`, `requestPurchaseOnPromotedProductIOS`
- Pre-commit hook now formats, analyzes, and runs tests by default

### Improvements rolled up from 6.5.2 / 6.5.3

- iOS price parsing now tolerates numeric values (fixes “double is not a
  subtype of String” crashes) and pins the OpenIAP Apple pod to `1.1.9` for
  repeatable installs.
- `fetchProducts()` always sets `product.id` (with fallbacks to
  `productId`/`sku`), and accepts `type: 'all'` so Android merges in-app + subs
  results.
- Products now centre on `id`; `productId` is kept for compatibility but is
  officially deprecated and scheduled for removal in 6.6.0.
- Deprecated Dart APIs: `fetchProducts()`, `purchaseAsync()`,
  `requestPurchaseAuto()`, `finalize()`, `deepLinkToSubscriptionsAndroid()`,
  and `getPurchaseHistories()`—switch to the modern APIs ahead of 6.6.0.
  (Use `fetchProducts()` and `requestPurchase()` as the replacements.)
- Examples suppress the alert dialog when users cancel an iOS purchase flow.

Podspec now requires `openiap ~> 1.1.8` (and 1.1.9 for Apple via CocoaPods).
Run `cd example/ios && pod install` after upgrading to refresh the lockfile.

See CHANGELOG for details. Thanks for all the feedback and reviews!
