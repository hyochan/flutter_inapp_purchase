- migration: integrate `openiap-google@1.1.11`
- migration: integrate `openiap-apple@1.1.12`

## 6.6.1

### Fixed

- iOS: Ensure `product.id` is always populated in `fetchProducts()` (fixes cases where id was empty on iOS). The parser now resolves id from the first non-empty of: `productId` → `id` → `sku` → `productIdentifier` (#550). In debug builds, logs which key was used.
  `withOpacity` in example UI.
- refactor: remove overridden field in `PurchaseIOS` (use `super.expirationDateIOS`).
- refactor: locally suppress legacy `jwsRepresentation` mapping and deprecated `requestPurchase` calls kept for backward compatibility.

### Changed

- Products API: `id` is the primary identifier for `Product`/`ProductSubscription`. `productId` is kept for backward compatibility only (see Deprecated).
- `fetchProducts()`: Adds support for `type: 'all'`.
  - iOS: passes `'all'` through the native `fetchProducts` call
  - Android: fetches `inapp` and `subs`, then merges results
- `productId` on `ProductCommon`: Use `id` instead (will be removed in 6.6.0).
- `Subscription` type name: Use `ProductSubscription` instead (will be removed in 6.6.0). The alias keeps existing code working.
- Parser now emits `ProductSubscription` (alias of `Subscription`) for subscriptions internally.
- Docs/Examples: Completed migration from `PurchasedItem` → `Purchase` in current docs/examples.

## 6.6.0

### Changed

- Android: Migrated native billing to openiap-google and simplified plugin with coroutines and connection gating.
- Android: Hardened null-safety and error logging; removed BuildConfig dependency in Amazon plugin.
- Dart: More robust product parsing (platform heuristics, per-item guards) and safer generics in fetchProducts.
- Example: Fixed sporadic setState after dispose by guarding mounted across async paths.

### Added

- iOS mixin: Convenience helpers (subscription group, App Store country, available items, typed app transaction, purchase histories).

### Tooling

- Pre-commit: Align dart format flags with CI and avoid staging untracked files.

### Deprecated

- Methods (removal in 6.6.0):
  - `fetchProducts()` → use `fetchProducts()`
  - `purchaseAsync()` → use `requestPurchase()`
  - `requestPurchaseAuto()` → use `requestPurchase()`
  - `finalize()` → use `endConnection()`
  - `deepLinkToSubscriptionsAndroid()` → use platform UI links as documented
  - `getPurchaseHistories()` → use `getAvailablePurchases(PurchaseOptions(onlyIncludeActiveItemsIOS: false))`

## 6.5.2

### Fixed

- iOS: Fix product/discount price parsing to tolerate numeric values (prevents `type 'double' is not a subtype of type 'String?'`), fixes #547.

### Changed

- iOS: pin OpenIAP Apple native module to `openiap 1.1.9` (exact version) to avoid unexpected CocoaPods minor updates.

### Notes

- Recommend upgrading to 6.5.2. Prior 6.5.0–6.5.1 allowed older constraints; this release enforces exact 1.1.9 for stability. No breaking changes.

## 6.5.1

### Changed

- iOS: bump OpenIAP Apple native module to `openiap ~> 1.1.8` (no breaking changes)
- iOS: unified error helper to `OpenIapError.defaultMessage` (OpenIAP 1.1.8 consolidation)

### Notes

- Example iOS Podfile pins tag `1.1.8`; run `cd example/ios && pod install` to refresh lockfile.

## 6.5.0

### Changed

- iOS: rename native channel method `buyProduct` to `requestPurchase` and update Dart to call `requestPurchase` (tests adjusted).
- iOS: standardize error codes/messages using OpenIAP (`OpenIapError.defaultMessage`) instead of ad‑hoc reason strings.
- Dart: make product parsing tolerant of numeric fields (e.g., price, subscriptionPeriodNumberIOS) to avoid type cast crashes.
- Restore flow: on iOS run `syncIOS()` (soft‑fail) then `getAvailablePurchases()`; on Android call `getAvailablePurchases()`.

### Added

- iOS mixin: `clearTransactionIOS`, `getPromotedProductIOS`, `requestPurchaseOnPromotedProductIOS` helpers.

### Removed

- iOS: remove no‑op `clearTransactionCache` channel case.
- Deprecated/legacy convenience methods: internal `getAppTransactionTyped`, `getProductsAsync`, `finishTransactionAsync`, non‑suffixed `presentCodeRedemptionSheet`/`showManageSubscriptions`.

### iOS Native

- Use OpenIAP error codes for `initConnection`, `fetchProducts`, `finishTransaction`, receipt validation and system UI calls.
- Purchase error event now emits `E_PURCHASE_ERROR` with standard message.

### CocoaPods

- Podspec requires `openiap ~> 1.1.7`. Example Podfile uses CDN and pins git tag when needed.

## 6.4.6

### Fixed

- **iOS**: Retrieve expired subscriptions in StoreKit 2 sandbox ([#543](https://github.com/hyochan/flutter_inapp_purchase/issues/543))
  - Added `PurchaseOptions` parameter to `getAvailablePurchases()` for OpenIAP compliance
  - Use `onlyIncludeActiveItemsIOS: false` to include expired subscriptions

### Deprecated

- `getPurchaseHistories()` → Use `getAvailablePurchases()` with options (removed in 6.6.0)

## 6.4.5

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Updated `getAvailablePurchases()` to support `PurchaseOptions` parameter (OpenIAP compliant)
  - Now accepts optional `PurchaseOptions` parameter for platform-specific configuration
  - iOS: Added `onlyIncludeActiveItemsIOS` option (default: true) to control whether expired subscriptions are included

### Added

- Added `PurchaseOptions` class with iOS-specific options:
  - `alsoPublishToEventListenerIOS`: Whether to also publish purchase events to the event listener when fetching available purchases
  - `onlyIncludeActiveItemsIOS`: Whether to only include active items (set to false to get expired subscriptions)
- **iOS**: Added `getPurchaseHistoriesIOS()` platform-specific method that retrieves all transactions including expired subscriptions

### Deprecated

- `getPurchaseHistories()` - Use `getAvailablePurchases(PurchaseOptions(onlyIncludeActiveItemsIOS: false))` instead (will be removed in 6.6.0)

### Bug Fixes

- **iOS**: Fixed missing transactionStateIOS field in getAvailableItems method ([#538](https://github.com/hyochan/flutter_inapp_purchase/issues/538))
- **iOS**: Fixed expired subscriptions not being returned in purchase history ([#543](https://github.com/hyochan/flutter_inapp_purchase/issues/543))
  - Added new iOS native method using `Transaction.all` instead of `Transaction.currentEntitlements`
  - This ensures all historical purchases including expired subscriptions are returned correctly

## 6.4.4

### Bug Fixes

- **Android**: Fixed FormatException when calling finishTransaction ([#539](https://github.com/hyochan/flutter_inapp_purchase/issues/539))

## 6.4.3

### Bug Fixes

- **iOS**: Replace ISO8601DateFormatter with millisecond timestamps for date fields ([#535](https://github.com/hyochan/flutter_inapp_purchase/issues/535))

  - Added proper parsing for `subscriptionOfferDetailsAndroid` in subscription products
  - Removed parsing of deprecated `subscriptionOfferDetails` field
  - Fixed Map type casting issues that could cause runtime errors with `Map<dynamic, dynamic>` inputs

### Improvements

- **Type Safety**: Improved type safety for JSON parsing across the codebase
  - Added safe JSON map conversion helper to prevent type casting errors
  - Fixed all unsafe `as Map<String, dynamic>` casts in `types.dart`
  - Ensures robust handling of platform channel data

## 6.4.1

### Improvements

- **ActiveSubscription Type**: Implemented a dedicated `ActiveSubscription` type for subscription APIs to provide better type safety and clearer subscription status information ([#532](https://github.com/hyochan/flutter_inapp_purchase/issues/532))
  - `getActiveSubscriptions()` now returns `List<ActiveSubscription>` instead of `List<SubscriptionPurchase>`
  - New type includes subscription-specific fields like `willExpireSoon` and `daysUntilExpirationIOS`
  - Automatically calculates expiration status for iOS subscriptions
  - Provides cleaner API with subscription-focused properties

## 6.4.0

### Breaking Changes

- **Simplified fetchProducts API**: The `fetchProducts` method now accepts direct parameters instead of a wrapper object (Fixes [#527](https://github.com/hyochan/flutter_inapp_purchase/issues/527))

  ```dart
  // Before (6.3.x)
  final products = await iap.fetchProducts(
    RequestProductsParams(
      skus: ['product_id'],
      type: PurchaseType.inapp,
    ),
  );

  // After (6.4.0)
  final products = await iap.fetchProducts(
    skus: ['product_id'],
    type: PurchaseType.inapp,  // Optional, defaults to PurchaseType.inapp
  );
  ```

  - Removed `RequestProductsParams` class
  - This change simplifies the API and improves developer experience based on user feedback

### New Features

- **DSL-like Builder Pattern for Purchase Requests**: Added a builder pattern API for more intuitive and type-safe purchase request construction

  ```dart
  // New builder pattern approach
  await iap.requestPurchaseWithBuilder(
    build: (r) => r
      ..type = PurchaseType.inapp
      ..withIOS((i) => i
        ..sku = 'product_id'
        ..quantity = 1)
      ..withAndroid((a) => a
        ..skus = ['product_id']),
  );
  ```

  - Provides better type safety with platform-specific configurations
  - Supports cascade notation for cleaner code
  - Separate builders for iOS and Android parameters
  - Available for both purchases and subscriptions

### Improvements

- **Replaced magic numbers with enums**: Android purchase states now use `AndroidPurchaseState` enum instead of hardcoded values (0, 1, 2)
  - Better code readability and maintainability
  - Type-safe state checking

### Deprecated Items Removed

The following deprecated items from v6.3.x have been removed in v6.4.0:

- `subscriptionOfferDetails` field (use `subscriptionOfferDetailsAndroid` instead)
- `prorationMode` field (use `replacementModeAndroid` instead)
- `AndroidProrationMode` typedef (use `AndroidReplacementMode` instead)

### Note to Users

We understand there have been several breaking changes recently. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience. These changes are part of our effort to quickly address the long maintenance gap and bring the library up to modern standards. With version 6.4.0, we believe the major restructuring is now complete, and the API should remain stable going forward.

**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/hyochan/flutter_inapp_purchase/compare/5.2.0...5.3.0>

## 5.2.0

Bugfix #356

## 5.1.1

Run on UiThread and few others (#328)

- Related #272

- The main difference is a new MethodResultWrapper class that wraps both the result and the channel. onMethodCall() now immediately saves this wrapped result-channel to a field and only uses that later to set both the result and to send back info on the channel. I did this in both Google and Amazon but I can't test the Amazon one.

- Included the plugin registration differences.

- Midified suggested in one of the issues that initConnection, endConnection and consumeAllItems shouldn't be accessors. This is very much so, property accessors are not supposed to do work and have side effects, just return a value. Now three new functions are suggested and marked the old ones deprecated.

Fourth, EnumUtil.getValueString() is not really necessary, we have describeEnum() in the Flutter engine just for this purpose.
